                <figcaption><h2> Chūbu-Sangaku National Park and the Japanese Alps</h2>
                    <p>Japan boasts a number of outstanding areas of natural beauty, many of them designated as national
                        parks or, in some cases, UNESCO World Heritage Sites. One of the country's most spectacular
                        parks is Chūbu-Sangaku National Park in the center of Honshu, incorporating in its northern and
                        central regions the group of mountains collectively referred to as the Hida Mountains, or
                        Japanese Alps. The region contains some of the highest peaks in the country, including Hotaka at
                        3,190 meters, and Yari at 3,180 meters. Similar in many ways to the Alps of Central Europe -
                        both in the character of the landscape and in its abundance of snow in winter - the Japanese
                        Alps attract large numbers of walkers and climbers in summer and skiers in winter. Of particular
                        interest is the park's abundance of flora and fauna, including the rare ptarmigan and mountain
                        antelopes found at higher altitudes. The park's many hot springs also draw visitors and led to
                        the development of various spas and holiday resorts, the best known being Kamikōchi.</p>

                    <h2>Mount Fuji</h2>
                    <p>Without a doubt Japan's most recognizable landmark, majestic Mount Fuji (Fuji-san) is also the
                        country's highest mountain peak, towering 3,776 meters over an otherwise largely flat landscape
                        to the south and east, and tall enough to be seen from Tokyo more than 100 kilometers away.
                        Mount Fuji has for centuries been celebrated in art and literature and is now considered so
                        important an icon that UNESCO recognized its world cultural significance in 2013. Part of the
                        Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, Mount Fuji is climbed by more than a million people each summer
                        as an act of pilgrimage, which culminates in watching the sunrise from its summit. While some
                        still choose to begin their climb from the base, the majority of climbers now start from above
                        the halfway mark, at the 5th Station, resulting in a more manageable six or so hour ascent. Of
                        course, for many, simply viewing the mountain from the distance, or from the comfort of a
                        speeding train, is enough to say "been there, done that."

                <figcaption><h2> Fukuoka Castle and the City's Ancient Festivals</h2>
                    <p>One of the few surviving examples of the once prolific and majestic hilltop homes preferred by
                        Shoguns and city rulers, Fukuoka Castle (Fukuoka-jō) is one of the highlights of a visit to
                        Fukuoka. Once part of a massive complex that covered an area of some 47,000 square meters, this
                        beautiful castle still impresses with its size and its position on a tall foundation overlooking
                        the Naka River. Fukuoka is also well known for its many events and festivals, in particular the
                        Hakata Gion Yamakasa, a famous two-week long, 700-year-old celebration held each July that draws
                        millions of visitors from across the country to its colorful parades, as well as its traditional
                        races and costumes. The city is not without its modern attractions, too, including Canal City
                        Hakata, a-city-within-the-city complete with a canal running through the complex along with
                        great shops, hotels, restaurants, and a theater.</p></figcaption>

                        off by the fact that the majority of the palace is closed to the public (it's still in use by
                        the Imperial family), as there is still enough to see simply by strolling the grounds. In
                        addition to the many fine views of the palace from numerous points in the surrounding parkland -
                        including the famous Nijubashi Bridge, or "double bridge," so named for its watery reflection -
                        visitors are permitted into the East Higashi-Gyoen Garden and other areas that are opened to the
                        public as part of an organized tour. Another must-see for tourists visiting Tokyo is the famous
                        Ginza shopping district, home to the Kabuki-za Theatre with its Kabuki performances, as well as
                        the Shimbashi Enbujo Theatre with its traditional Azuma-odori dances and Bunraku

                <figcaption><h2>Historic Kyoto</h2>
                    <p>One of Japan's most visited cities, lovely Kyoto - one of the few cities in the country to be
                        spared the devastation of WWII - attracts more than 10 million visitors annually to explore its
                        fine old streets and architecture, much of it unchanged since the Imperial family took up
                        residence here more than 1,000 years ago. Even then, the city was Japan's most important
                        cultural center, a legacy that continues with its many museums and art galleries, each bursting
                        with important sculptures, paintings, and other art forms. Highlights of Kyoto's
                        Buddhist-influenced architecture include its many well-preserved temples, 30 of which are still
                        in use, and important structures such as the 14th-century Golden Pavilion (Kinkaku-ji), famous
                        for its exquisite gold-leaf-clad exterior. Be sure to also visit Nijo Castle, a 17th-century
                        fortress that has retained its original walls, towers, and moat; its beautiful gates; and its
                        palace with fine interior décor. Also worth a visit is the original Kyoto Imperial Palace
                        (Kyoto-gosho), built in AD 794 and one of the city's most visited historic sites. Finally, no
                        visit to Kyoto is complete without spending time exploring the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, a
                        beautiful area of tall bamboo just a few minutes' walk from the town center.</p></figcaption>

                        addition to its many historic streets, the city boasts numerous important old temples, including
                        the magnificent seventh-century Kofuku-ji Temple, perhaps the best known of the Seven Great
                        Temples of Nara; and the splendid eighth-century Todai-ji (Great East Temple), famous for its
                        huge bronze statue of the Great Buddha (Daibutsu), cast here in AD 749. Also of interest in
                        Todai-ji are its Great South Gate (Nandaimon), a two-story structure borne on 18 columns with
                        two Nio statues standing eight meters tall and guarding the temple entrance, and the Hall of the

                    <p>Just a short ferry ride from mainland Hiroshima is the island of Miyajima, famous the world over
                        as Japan's Shrine Island. Covering an area of 30 square kilometers in Hiroshima Bay, Miyajima is
                        best known as the home of the Itsukushima Shrine, a Shinto temple dedicated to the Princess
                        daughters of the wind god Susanoo. Dating from the eighth century, the majority of the shrine's
                        buildings rise out of the waters of a small bay supported only by piles. The effect at high tide
                        is simply stunning, making these structures - including the famous Great Floating Gate (O-Torii)
                        - appear as if they're floating on water. Linked together by walkways and bridges, it's a
                        fascinating place to explore, in particular its larger halls such as the exquisite Honden (Main
                        Hall), the Offerings Hall (Heiden), the Prayer Hall (Haiden), and the Hall of a Thousand Mats
                        (Senjokaku). Another notable feature is the shrine's stage where visitors are entertained with
                        traditional dances and musical performances. Also worth exploring are the island's exquisite
                        grounds and gardens, home to wild deer and numerous bird colonies.</p>

                    <p>The Atsuta Shrine, in the heart of the city of Nagoya, is the most important Shinto shrine in
                        Japan, and attracts more than five million visitors each year. Established in the first century,
                        this religious site is famous for its preserved Imperial insignia, the "grass-mowing sword"
                        (kusanagi-no-tsurugi), one of only three in the country. Also of interest are its principal
                        shrine, Hongu, surrounded by an enclosing wall, and the treasury with its numerous works of art,
                        including old and modern paintings, ceramics, jewelry, and traditional masks. While in Nagoya,
                        be sure to also visit Nagoya Castle, a splendid moated complex built in 1612 boasting a
                        48-meter-high main tower that is famous for its two gilded dolphins (shachi), its museum
                        containing art treasures from the former palace, and its spectacular views over the city and the

                    <p>Built in 1586 by famous Japanese warrior and politician Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Osaka Castle
                        (Ōsaka-jō) was at the time the largest and most important fortress in the country. Although
                        destroyed and rebuilt a number of times since, the present structure, built in 1931, remains
                        true to the original. Highlights of a visit include the huge five-story, 42-meter-tall main
                        tower built on an imposing 14-meter-tall stone base and home to a number of displays detailing
                        the history of the castle and the city; be sure to visit the top floor for its superb views over
                        Osaka, an especially attractive sight as the sun sets. Also of interest in Osaka Castle Park is
                        the Hokoku Shrine, while Osaka's best-known temple, Shitennō-ji, is also worth visiting and
                        dates back to AD 59. Notable as Japan's first Buddhist temple, this lovely shrine features a
                        five-story pagoda along with a number of other exquisitely decorated buildings including the
                        Golden Pavilion (Kondō) with its fine statues and paintings, the Lecture Hall (Kōdō), and a

                    <p>Located on Japan's northernmost island, Hokkaido, the city of Sapporo offers many things to see
                        and do for tourists. As the island's largest city, it's a hub of cultural activity, hosting many
                        excellent events and festivals; a distinctive culinary style; a rich theatrical history; and
                        plenty of museums, galleries, and parks. The focal point here is very much the city's attractive
                        downtown area, the center of which is Odori Park, a large swath of green that's very pleasant to
                        explore. From here, you can also access points of interest such as the Sapporo TV Tower, as well
                        as the city's famous aerial tramway, an easy walk away. The Mount Moiwa Ropeway will eventually
                        get you to the summit's Upper Station, from where you can enjoy incredible views over the city,
                        a real treat at night. The mountain is also the location of the Mount Moiwa Ski Resort, a
                        popular winter destination, especially since the 1972 Winter Olympics were held in the city. And
                        if you're arriving in winter, be sure to visit the Sapporo Snow Festival, held here each
                        February and drawing in excess of two million revelers.
